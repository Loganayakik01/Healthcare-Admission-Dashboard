Hospital Analytics SQL Views

This SQL script creates **analytic-ready views** on the hospital database, enabling **quick insights and reporting** without complex joins every time.

Key Views

1. **`vw_AdmissionDetails`**

   * Consolidates **patient, admission, department, doctor, branch, billing, and outcome data** into a single view.
   * Ideal for **executive dashboards** or **detailed admission analysis**.
   * Columns include:

     * Patient info (`patient_name`, `age`, `gender`)
     * Admission details (`admission_datetime`, `discharge_datetime`, `length_of_stay`, `is_readmission`)
     * Department, doctor, branch
     * Financial and outcome data (`total_cost`, `outcome`)

2. **`vw_DoctorWorkload`**

   * Summarizes **doctor utilization** based on procedures.
   * Tracks:

     * Total procedures performed
     * Actual hours spent
     * Utilization percentage vs available hours
   * Useful for **resource planning and workload balancing**.

 Example Queries

* `SELECT TOP 10 * FROM vw_DoctorWorkload;` → quickly identifies **most and least utilized doctors**.
* `SELECT TOP 3 * FROM bed_occupancy;` → monitors **critical bed occupancy snapshots** for operational alerts.

**Purpose:** Enables **self-service reporting**, **KPI tracking**, and **dashboarding** for hospital management without writing repetitive joins.
